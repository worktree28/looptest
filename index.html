		loopMIT is a dedicated team of undergraduate students from various fields of engineering working on designing , developing and building a sub scale prototype transport vehicle known as the Hyperloop Pod to partake in the “SpaceX Hyperloop pod design competition” ,where a number of student teams from across the world participate to demonstrate the technical feasibility of various aspects of the Hyperloop concept . We aim to be the first Asian team to enter the competition with a levitating pod.<br><br>
		A Hyperloop  is a mode of passenger and freight transportation, used to describe an open-source vacuum tube train design released by a joint team from Tesla and SpaceX. Hyperloop is a sealed tube or system of tubes through which a pod may travel free of air resistance or friction conveying people or objects at high speeds efficiently, drastically reducing travel times over medium-range distances.
<!-- 		<br> 
The concept was unveiled in 2013 by Elon Musk- founder of SpaceX and Tesla, in which he proposed a “fifth mode of transport” comprised of pressurized capsules riding on an air cushion driven by linear induction motors and air compressors. In 2015, a design competition was announced for teams to build Hyperloop pods to operate on a SpaceX sponsored track. If successful, this would revolutionize the field of transportation across the world	 -->
